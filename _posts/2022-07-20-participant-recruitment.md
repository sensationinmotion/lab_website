We are recruiting participants for a study investigating how people feel very small features with their fingertips. Participation will take about 1 hour and you will be compensated for your time. If you are interested in helping us out with this study, please fill out the [screening survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6qruOkoNmTQQHQRt1N399WXXbTzGlYas6rO0gDIKB5qBrjQ/viewform?usp=sf_link") (you may need to click through the title of this post to see it) and we will follow up with you. Thank you for your interest!
