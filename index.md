# Body, meet world

Welcome to the Sensation in Motion Lab at San Diego State University! We study (1) how the physical organization of sensory systems in the skin and muscle affect human movement, and (2) how to use movement analysis to test sensory systems to diagnsose sensory pathologies and measure recovery.

Movement and sensation are inextricably linked. While we often say humans are visual creatures, the sensory systems that allow us to feel how our body is configured (proprioception) and what it is in contact with (touch) underlie our ability to effectively interact with the physical world. The motor system has privileged access to these sensations, so understanding them requires interrogating the motor system itself.
